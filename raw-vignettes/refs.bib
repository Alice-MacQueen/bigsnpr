abstract = {To the Editor: In the September 2007 issue of The Journal, Tang et al. analyzed data from 192 Puerto Ricans geno- typed at 112,584 autosomal markers and identified three regions with a deficiency in the proportion of European ancestry. They concluded that recent selection occurred at these regions after the admixture of European, African, and Native American ancestors.1 These signals of selection are very strong:We estimate that they each correspond to selection coefficients of {\textgreater}0.08 per generation, which if confirmed would represent the three most powerful selec- tive adaptations discovered to date in humans. Here, we demonstrate that on the basis of the method the authors applied, these signals of selection could be explained as ar- tifacts of the unusual long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) that occurs at these regions and that is not specific to Puerto Ricans.We failed to replicate the signal of selec- tion in an independent and larger study of 364 Puerto Ri- can samples, when we applied a method that is not suscep- tible to this confounder. Our results highlight a complexity in the analysis of dense genotype data from recently admixed populations; this complexity needs to be taken into account not only in genome-wide screens for selec- tion but also in genome-wide association studies to ensure that false-positive signals are avoided.},

abstract = {Genetic variation in a population can be summarized through principal component analysis (PCA) on genome-wide data. PCs derived from such analyses are valuable for genetic association studies, where they can correct for population stratification. We investigated how to capture the genetic population structure in a well-characterized sample from the Netherlands and in a worldwide data set and examined whether (1) removing long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions and LD-based SNP pruning significantly improves correlations between PCs and geography and (2) whether genetic differentiation may have been influenced by migration and/or selection. In the Netherlands, three PCs showed significant correlations with geography, distinguishing between: (1) North and South; (2) East and West; and (3) the middle-band and the rest of the country. The third PC only emerged with minimized LD, which also significantly increased correlations with geography for the other two PCs. In addition to geography, the Dutch North–South PC showed correlations with genome-wide homozygosity (r ¼ 0.245), which may reflect a serial-founder effect due to northwards migration, and also with height ({\#}: r ¼ 0.142, {\~{}}: r ¼ 0.153). The divergence between subpopulations identified by PCs is partly driven by selection pressures. The first three PCs showed significant signals for diversifying selection (545 SNPs -the majority within 184 genes). The strongest signal was observed between North and South for the functional SNP in HERC2 that determines human blue/brown eye color. Thus, this study demonstrates how to increase ancestry signals in a relatively homogeneous population and how those signals can reveal evolutionary history.},

@article{Dubois2010,
abstract = {We performed a second-generation genome-wide association study of 4,533 individuals with celiac disease (cases) and 10,750 control subjects. We genotyped 113 selected SNPs with P(GWAS) {\textless} 10(-4) and 18 SNPs from 14 known loci in a further 4,918 cases and 5,684 controls. Variants from 13 new regions reached genome-wide significance (P(combined) {\textless} 5 x 10(-8)); most contain genes with immune functions (BACH2, CCR4, CD80, CIITA-SOCS1-CLEC16A, ICOSLG and ZMIZ1), with ETS1, RUNX3, THEMIS and TNFRSF14 having key roles in thymic T-cell selection. There was evidence to suggest associations for a further 13 regions. In an expression quantitative trait meta-analysis of 1,469 whole blood samples, 20 of 38 (52.6{\%}) tested loci had celiac risk variants correlated (P {\textless} 0.0028, FDR 5{\%}) with cis gene expression.},

@article{Prive2017,
abstract = {Genome-wide datasets produced for association studies have dramatically increased in size over the past few years, with modern datasets commonly including millions of variants measured in dozens of thousands of individuals. This increase in data size is a major challenge severely slowing down genomic analyses. Specialized software for every part of the analysis pipeline have been developed to handle large genomic data. However, combining all these software into a single data analysis pipeline might be technically difficult. Here we present two R packages, bigstatsr and bigsnpr, allowing for management and analysis of large scale genomic data to be performed within a single comprehensive framework. To address large data size, the packages use memory-mapping for accessing data matrices stored on disk instead of in RAM. To perform data pre-processing and data analysis, the packages integrate most of the tools that are commonly used, either through transparent system calls to existing software, or through updated or improved implementation of existing methods. In particular, the packages implement a fast derivation of Principal Component Analysis, functions to remove SNPs in Linkage Disequilibrium, and algorithms to learn Polygenic Risk Scores on millions of SNPs. We illustrate applications of the two R packages by analysing a case-control genomic dataset for the celiac disease, performing an association study and computing Polygenic Risk Scores. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the R packages by analyzing a simulated genome-wide dataset including 500,000 individuals and 1 million markers on a single desktop computer.},
