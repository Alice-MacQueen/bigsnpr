## bigsnpr 0.2.7

- faster defaults + possibility to estimate correlations based on a subset of individuals for `snp_fastImpute`. Also store infos in an FBM (instead of a data frame) so that imputation can be done by parts.

## bigsnpr 0.2.5

- **This package won't be on CRAN**.

## bigsnpr 0.2.4

- No longer download PLINK automatically (because it is a CRAN policy violation).
