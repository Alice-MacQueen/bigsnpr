Reading map (extended format) from [ HapMap3.bim ] 
14389 markers to be included from [ HapMap3.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ HapMap3.fam ] 
957 individuals read from [ HapMap3.fam ] 
957 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
