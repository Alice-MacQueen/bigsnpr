4542 markers to be included from [ /home/privef/Bureau/bigsnpr/inst/extdata/example.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ /home/privef/Bureau/bigsnpr/inst/extdata/example.fam ] 
517 individuals read from [ /home/privef/Bureau/bigsnpr/inst/extdata/example.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 517 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 517 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 517 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
These individuals will be set to missing ( or use --allow-no-sex )
Writing list of these individuals to [ plink.nosex ]
Reading genotype bitfile from [ /home/privef/Bureau/bigsnpr/inst/extdata/example.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4542 SNPs
517 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4542 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 517 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 517 of unspecified sex
Performing LD-based pruning...
Writing pruned-in SNPs to [ plink.prune.in ]
Writing pruned-out SNPs to [ plink.prune.out ]
Scanning from chromosome 1 to 1

Scan region on chromosome 1 from [ SNP0 ] to [ SNP4541 ]
For chromosome 1, 159 SNPs pruned out, 4383 remaining
